## Ready-to-assemble AI

Welcome, brave explorer! We are still in stealth mode (of sorts), but we are glad you found us.

Flatpack democratises AI and ML through micro language models and model compression. Our platform enables users to train custom models with 100M to 10B parameters. We introduce flatpacks (FPKs) to integrate AI and ML into edge computing, electronic components, and robots.

> **Flatpack:** "Picture merging the Swedish ingenuity of flatpacks (hence our name) and ready-to-assemble furniture with the imaginative appeal of certain Danish snap-together toy bricks. Our method of developing micro language models is designed to be intelligently integrated into the physical world."

## Edge artificial intelligence

Edge artificial intelligence uses local devices to enhance decision-making near data sources, improving privacy, response times,  and security while reducing reliance on cloud connectivity. Benefits include decreased latency, improved scalability, and reduced energy usage.

> "Edge artificial intelligence (AI), or AI at the edge, is the implementation of artificial intelligence in an edge computing environment, which allows computations to be done close to where data is actually collected, rather than at a centralized cloud computing facility or an offsite data center." ([Red Hat 2023](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/edge-computing/what-is-edge-ai))

## Flatpack 3.X.X (Aglaonice)

*Aglaonice, an ancient Greek astronomer from the 2nd or 1st century BC, was celebrated for her precise lunar eclipse predictions. Her mastery inspired the Greek proverb: "As the moon obeys Aglaonice," signifying unwavering certainty.*

## Quick start

**NOTE:** Flatpack is currently experimental. Please refrain from using it in production environments.

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install flatpack
```

```bash
# Check version
flatpack version
```

```bash
# List all available flatpacks
flatpack list
```

```bash
# Unbox a flatpack of your choice
# flatpack unbox <flatpack_name> --local
flatpack unbox <flatpack_name>
```

```bash
# And last, but not least
flatpack build <flatpack_name>
```

## AgentManager

```bash
# fast_api_test.py uses microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf (MIT)
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romlingroup/flatpack/main/agents/fast_api_test.py
flatpack agents spawn fast_api_test.py
```

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/generate-response/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "context": "<context_description>",
  "question": "<your_question>"
}'
```

```bash
flatpack agents list
```

```bash
flatpack agents terminate <pid>
```

## VectorManager (HNSW)

Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs excel as indexes for vector similarity searches with leading-edge results through high recall rates and rapid search capabilities.

```bash
flatpack vector add-texts "<text_1>", "<text_2>"
```

```bash
flatpack vector add-pdf <pdf_filename>
```

```bash
flatpack vector add-wikipedia "<wikipedia_page_title>"
```

```bash
flatpack vector search-text "<search_query>"
```

### Code signing

Our platform will use [RSA keys](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>) to authenticate and safeguard the integrity of flatpacks (FPK).

> **Security note:** This project utilizes 4096-bit RSA keys for code signing. Breaking such encryption with current classical computing resources is computationally prohibitive\*. The analogy often used is that it would be akin to cataloguing every star in the known universe - multiple times.

> \* ["Post-quantum cryptography"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography) (Wikipedia 2023) / ["Did China Break The Quantum Barrier?"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurherman/2023/01/10/did-china-break-the-quantum-barrier/) (Arthur Herman 2023) / ["No, RSA Encryption Isn't Obsolete"](https://www.aei.org/foreign-and-defense-policy/no-rsa-encryption-isnt-obsolete/) (Jason Blessing 2023) / ["Toward Quantum Resilient Security Keys"](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/toward-quantum-resilient-security-keys.html) (Google 2023)

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -aes256 -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
```

```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -in private_key.pem -out public_key.pem
```

#### Command-line options

To run the test script, use the following command-line options:

- `-i` or `--input`: Specifies the input file or folder (e.g., `hello_world`).
- `-o` or `--output`: Specifies where the compressed file will be saved (e.g., `compressed_file.fpk`).
- `-s` or `--signed`: Specifies where the signed file will be saved (e.g., `signed_file.fpk`).
- `-p` or `--private_key`: Specifies the path to the private key used for code signing (e.g., `private_key.pem`).
- `--hash_size`: (Optional) Specifies the hash size for code signing. The default is `256`.
- `--passphrase`: (Optional) Specifies the passphrase for the private key. The default is `None`.

##### Example

```bash
PASSPHRASE=$(python -c 'import getpass; print(getpass.getpass("Enter the passphrase: "))')
```

```bash
python bulk_compress_and_sign_fpk.py -p private_key.pem --passphrase $PASSPHRASE
```

##### Verification

```bash
python bulk_verify_signed_data_with_cli.py --public_key public_key.pem
```

## Micro language models ü§è

[Micro language models](http://microlanguagemodels.com) with around 100M to 10B parameters, offer a compelling alternative to the deployment and scalability challenges associated with traditional large language models (LLMs). Their smaller size allows for rapid pre-training and fine-tuning, enabling organisations to adapt quickly to market changes or specific requirements. Micro language models can be deployed in edge-adjacent environments like laptops, microprocessors, or smartphones.

Overall, micro language models represent a logical step in the evolution of language models, effectively merging the capabilities of LLMs with the practical needs of real-world applications.
