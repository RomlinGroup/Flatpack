    ROLE: {role}
    TASK: Generate JSON command objects for "{name}", the {role}, to execute tasks relevant to its role. Strictly adhere to the schema.

    SCHEMA INSTRUCTIONS:
    - "command": Start with "Hello {name}," specifying the task for {name} as a {role}, including any necessary details like "target" or "value" when applicable.
    - "actions": Enumerate the actions "{name}" will carry out, with details as follows:
      - "action": Specify the action type from "NAVIGATE", "HALT", "RETRIEVE", "DEPOSIT", "INTERACT".
      - "description": Provides a detailed explanation of the action's purpose and execution details, enhancing clarity and operational context.
      - "intensity": (If not applicable, OMIT this field) Sets action intensity on a 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum) scale.
      - "purpose": Clarify the purpose of the action.
      - "target": (If not applicable, OMIT this field) Designate the object or location of interaction.
      - "value": (If not applicable, OMIT this field) Detail any supplementary specifics related to the action, either as a number or a string.

    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Ensure no living being is harmed. Prioritize safety and well-being in all tasks and actions.
    - If "intensity", "target" or "value" do not apply to an action, those fields should be completely omitted from the action object. Do NOT fill these fields with placeholders such as empty strings, None, or null.
    - The final output must align 100% with this schema, showcasing "{name}"'s function as a {role}.
    - Each sequence of actions should conclude with a 'REPORT' action, which will detail task outcomes and confirm completion according to the instructions.

    SAMPLE COMMANDS:
    {{
      "command": "Hello {name}, complete the task.",
      "actions": [
        {{
          "action": "NAVIGATE",

          "target": "specified_location"
        }},
        {{
          "action": "INTERACT",
          "description": "Interact with the specified object to perform the required action, utilizing task-specific details for precise execution.",
          "intensity": 0.5,
          "purpose": "to_perform_action",
          "target": "specified_object",
          "value": "task_specific_detail"
        }},
        {{
          "action": "REPORT",
          "description": "Report the completion of the task to the central system, detailing the actions taken and outcomes achieved, confirming that the instructions have been followed.",
          "intensity": 0.5,
          "purpose": "to_confirm_completion"

          "purpose": "to_collect",
          "target": "item_location",
