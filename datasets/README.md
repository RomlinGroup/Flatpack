## DATASET.md ðŸ“–

[DATASET.md](https://github.com/romlingroup/flatpack-ai/blob/main/datasets/DATASET.md) is our meticulously crafted Markdown template (under development), established to act as a standard for encapsulating the essentials of any dataset. By streamlining the documentation process, this template ensures that all relevant details about the dataset are easily accessible, facilitating seamless collaboration and utilization.

Markdown is ideal for documenting datasets as it is lightweight and easy to archive. Its format helps keep data and documentation in sync, essential for research integrity and reproducibility. Markdown files and datasets can also be version-controlled, ensuring a cohesive historical record.

Once completed, it will be a mandatory component in all flatpacks.
