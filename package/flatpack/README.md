this stage.

## Moving to Versioning Structure: 3.0.0

Our previous releases were a mix of minor tweaks and significant shifts, making it challenging to anticipate the nature
of changes. With the introduction of version 3.0.0, we are embracing a structured and predictable release strategy:

- **Major versions** (`X.0.0`): These signify significant changes or updates.
- **Minor versions** (`3.X.0`): Introduce new features without breaking compatibility.
- **Patch versions** (`3.0.X`): Address bug fixes and minor refinements.

This move is not merely about [semantics](https://semver.org/). It is a pledge for clear communication and trust with our users. We invite you to
explore our new release strategy, and appreciate your patience as we evolve.
