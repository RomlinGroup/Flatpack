## flatpack 3.X.X (Aglaonice)

*Aglaonice, an ancient Greek astronomer from the 2nd or 1st century BC, was celebrated for her precise lunar eclipse predictions. Her mastery inspired the Greek proverb: "As the moon obeys Aglaonice," signifying unwavering certainty.*

## Moving to versioning structure: 3.0.0

Our previous releases were a mix of minor tweaks and significant shifts, making it challenging to anticipate the nature of changes. With the introduction of version 3.0.0, we are embracing a predictable and structured release strategy:

- **Major versions** (`X.0.0`): These signify significant changes or updates.
- **Minor versions** (`3.X.0`): Introduce new features without breaking compatibility.
- **Patch versions** (`3.0.X`): Address bug fixes and minor refinements.

This move is not merely about [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). It is a pledge for clear communication and trust with our users. We invite you to explore our new release strategy and appreciate your patience as we evolve.
